## Compilation instructions

<a name="dep"></a>
### Dependencies

MACHINA is written in C++11 and thus requires a modern C++ compiler (GCC >= 4.8.1, or Clang). In addition, MACHINA has the following dependencies.

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) (>= 2.8)
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (>= 1.38)
* [LEMON](http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon) graph library (>= 1.3)
* [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com) (>= 6.0)

[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) is required to visualize the resulting DOT files, but is not required for compilation.

In case [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) is available, extended source code documentation will be generated.

<a name="comp"></a>
### Compilation

To compile MACHINA, execute the following commands from the root of the repository:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

In case CMake fails to detect LEMON or Gurobi, run the following command with adjusted paths:

    $ cmake -DLIBLEMON_ROOT=~/lemon \
    -DGUROBI_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/gurobi702/linux64/include \
    -DGUROBI_CPP_LIB=/usr/local/gurobi702/linux64/lib/libgurobi_c++.a \
    -DGUROBI_LIB=/usr/local/lib/libguroibi70.so ..

The compilation results in the following files in the `build` directory:

### I/O formats

Below we describe the various formats used by the algorithms of the `MACHINA` framework.

<a name="clonetree"></a>
#### Clone tree

A clone tree is provided as an edge list. Each line specifies an edge by listing the labels of the incident vertices separated by a space or tab character. For example:

    A A1
    A A2
    A A3
    A A4
    A A5
    A A6
    ...

See [patient1.tree](data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.tree) for the complete clone tree.

<a name="leaflabeling"></a>
#### Leaf labeling

A leaf labeling assigns an anatomical site label to each leaf of a clone tree. Each line contains two values, the leaf label and the anatomical site label separated by a space or tab character. For example:

    A1 Om
    A2 SBwl
    A3 LFTB
    A4 LOv
    A5 ApC
    A6 RFTA
    ...

See [patient1.labeling](data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.labeling) for the complete leaf labeling.

<a name="vertexlabeling"></a>
#### Vertex labeling

A vertex labeling assigns an anatomical site label to each vertex of a clone tree (including the leaves). Each line contains two values, the vertex label and the anatomical site label separated by a space or tab character. For example:

    A ROv
    B SBwl
    D ROv
    F ROv
    H ROv
    A1 Om
    A2 SBwl
    ...

See [patient1.reported.labeling](data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.reported.labeling) for the complete vertex labeling.

#### Frequencies

A frequency file encodes the frequency of every mutation (cluster) in an anatomical site (sample). It is a tab separated file. The first line lists the number of anatomical sites followed by the number of samples and then the number of mutations, each on separate lines. The fourth line is ignored but describes the format of the rest of the file. Each subsequent line encodes the cell frequency of a mutation in a sample: first the sample 0-based index is given, followed by the label of the sample, the 0-based index of the anatomical site, the anatomical site label, the 0-based index of the mutation, the label of the mutation, the frequency lower bound and upper bound.

    6 #anatomical sites							
    6 #samples							
    10 #mutation clusters							
    #sample_index	sample_label	anatomical_site_index	anatomical_site_label	character_index	character_label	f_lb	f_ub
    0	breast	0	breast	0	1	0.503628522	0.545237495
    0	breast	0	breast	1	2	0	0.01213794
    ...

See [F.tsv](data/hoadley_2016/A7/F.tsv) for the complete frequency file.

### Parsimonious Migration History (`pmh_sankoff` and `pmh`)

In the parsimonious migration history we are given a clone tree `T` whose leaves are labeled by anatomical sites. The task is to label the inner vertices of `T` such that the resulting migration graph `G` has minimum migration number and comigration number. Additionally, it is possible to specify constraints on the topology of the migration graph.

PATTERN | DESCRIPTION
--------|------------
PS (parallel single-source seeding) | Each metastatic site is seeded directly from the primary tumor, i.e. `G` is a multi-tree such that the primary `P` is the only vertex with out-degree greater than 1.
S (single-source seeding) | Each metastatic site is seeded from only one other anatomical site, i.e. `G` is a multi-tree.
M (multi-source seeding) | A metastatic site may be seeded from multiple anatomical sites, but no directed cycles are introduced. That is, `G` is multi-DAG.
R (reseeding) | Directed cycles in `G` are allowed.

In our algorithms we allow for the following restrictions on the migration pattern:

1. Unrestricted: PS, S, M and R
2. No reseeding: PS, S, M
3. No reseeding and no multi-source seeding: PS and S
4. No reseeding, no multi-source seeding and no single-source seeding: PS

The unconstrained PMH problem can be solved by running `pmh_sankoff`, which is an adaptation of the Sankoff algorithm and enumerates all migration histories:

    Usage:
    ./pmh_sankoff [--help|-h|-help] [-c str] [-o str] [-p str] T leaf_labeling
    Where:
    T
        Clone tree
    leaf_labeling
        Leaf labeling
    --help|-h|-help
        Print a short help message
    -c str
        Color map file
    -o str
        Output prefix
    -p str
        Primary anatomical sites separated by commas (if omitted, every
        anatomical site will be considered iteratively as the primary)

An example execution of the `pmh_sankoff` algorithm:

    $ mkdir patient1
    $ ./pmh_sankoff -p LOv,ROv -c ../data/mcpherson_2016/coloring.txt \
    ../data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.tree \
    ../data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.labeling \
    -o patient1/ 2> patient1/result.txt
    
    $ cat patient1/result.txt
    Clone tree has 7 samples
    Found 4 maximum parsimony labelings with primary 'LOv'
    Found 2 labelings with 7 comigrations, 2 seeding sites and R
    Found 2 labelings with 11 comigrations, 3 seeding sites and R
    Labeling 0: 13 migrations, 11 comigrations, 3 seeding sites and R
    Labeling 1: 13 migrations, 11 comigrations, 3 seeding sites and R
    Labeling 2: 13 migrations, 7 comigrations, 2 seeding sites and R
    Labeling 3: 13 migrations, 7 comigrations, 2 seeding sites and R
    Found 1 maximum parsimony labelings with primary 'ROv'
    Found 1 labelings with 10 comigrations, 2 seeding sites and M
    Labeling 0: 13 migrations, 10 comigrations, 2 seeding sites and M

The above command considers the left ovary (LOv) and right ovary (ROv) as the primary tumor site and enumerates all minimum migration vertex labelings of the given clone tree and leaf labeling. The output is stored in the directory patient1. In the DOT files the given color map is used for coloring the anatomical sites.

To further constrain the migration graph, we can use `pmh`:


    Usage:
      ./pmh [--help|-h|-help] [-G str] [-OLD] [-UB_gamma int] [-UB_mu int]
         [-UB_sigma int] -c str [-e] [-g] [-l int] [-log] [-m str] [-o str]
         -p str [-t int] T leaf_labeling
    Where:
      T
         Clone tree
      leaf_labeling
         Leaf labeling
      --help|-h|-help
         Print a short help message
      -G str
         Optional file with migration graphs
      -OLD
         Use old ILP (typically much slower)
      -UB_gamma int
         Upper bound on the comigration number (default: -1, disabled)
      -UB_mu int
         Upper bound on the migration number (default: -1, disabled)
      -UB_sigma int
         Upper bound on the seeding site number (default: -1, disabled)
      -c str
         Color map file
      -e
         Export ILP
      -g
         Output search graph
      -l int
         Time limit in seconds (default: -1, no time limit)
      -log
         Gurobi logging
      -m str
         Allowed migration patterns:
           0 : PS
           1 : PS, S
           2 : PS, S, M
           3 : PS, S, M, R
         If no pattern is specified, all allowed patterns will be enumerated.
      -o str
         Output prefix
      -p str
         Primary anatomical site
      -t int
         Number of threads (default: -1, #cores)


An example execution of the `pmh` algorithm:

    $ mkdir patient1_constrained
    $ ./pmh -p LOv -c ../data/mcpherson_2016/coloring.txt \
    ../data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.tree \
    ../data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.labeling \
    -o patient1_constrained/ > patient1_constrained/result.txt
    
    $ cat patient1_constrained/result.txt
    LOv-	(PS)	15	6	1	pPS	15.125	15.125	0.0892799
    LOv-	(PS, S)	15	6	1	pPS	15.125	15.125	0.10285
    LOv-	(PS, S, M)	15	6	1	pPS	15.125	15.125	0.107245
    LOv-	(PS, S, M, R)	13	7	2	pR	13.148	13.148	0.480087

Each line lists the solution found by MACHINA. First the primary anatomical site is given, then the provided migration pattern restriction set, followed by the migration number, comigration number and seeding site number. Finally, the identified migration pattern is given, followed by a lower bound (LB) on the optimal solution and then an upper bound (UB), ending with the total running time in seconds. In case LB == UB, the identified solution is optimal.

### Parsimonious Migration History with Tree Resolution (`pmh_tr`)

In the parsimonious migration history with polytomy resolution we are given a clone tree `T` whose leaves are labeled by anatomical sites. The task is to find a refinement `T'` of `T` and label its inner vertices of such that the resulting migration graph `G` has minimum migration number, comigration number and seeding site number. It is possible to specify constraints on the topology of the migration graph.

         [-UB_sigma int] -c str [-e] [-g] [-l int] [-log] [-m str] [-o str]

      leaf_labeling
         Leaf labeling
      --help|-h|-help
         Print a short help message
      -G str
         Optional file with migration graphs
      -OLD
         Use old ILP (typically much slower)

           1 : PS, S
           2 : PS, S, M
           3 : PS, S, M, R
         If no pattern is specified, all allowed patterns will be
         enumerated (default: '0,1,2,3')
      -o str
         Output prefix
      -p str
         Primary anatomical site
      -t int
         Number of threads (default: -1, #cores)

An example execution:

    ../data/mcpherson_2016/patient1.labeling \
    -o patient1_tr/ 2> patient1_tr/result.txt
    
    $ cat patient1_tr/result.txt
    LOv-	(PS)	12	6	1	pPS	12125	12125	0.271094
    LOv-	(PS, S)	12	6	1	pPS	12125	12125	0.34085
    LOv-	(PS, S, M)	12	6	1	pPS	12125	12125	0.373354
    LOv-	(PS, S, M, R)	11	7	2	pR	11148	11148	6.48791


The `results.txt` file is formatted in exactly the same way as `pmh`.

### Parsimonious Migration History with Tree Inference (`pmh_cti`)

Given a mutation tree `T` with mutation frequencies `F-` and `F+`, the task is to find a frequency assignment `F` yielding a refined clone tree `T'` that admits a vertex labeling `l` such that the resulting migration graph `G` has minimum number of migrations and comigrations. It is possible to specify constraints on the topology of the migration graph.

      ./pmh_ti [--help|-h|-help] -F str [-G str] [-OLD] [-UB_gamma int]
         [-UB_mu int] [-UB_sigma int] -barT str -c str [-e] [-g] [-l int] [-log]
         [-m str] [-mutTreeIdx int] [-noPR] [-o str] -p str [-t int]

      -m str
         Allowed migration patterns:
           0 : PS
           1 : PS, S
           2 : PS, S, M
           3 : PS, S, M, R
         If no pattern is specified, all allowed patterns will be
         enumerated (default: '0,1,2,3')

An example execution:

    $ mkdir A7
    $ ./generatemutationtrees ../data/hoadley_2016/A7/F.tsv > A7/mutation_trees.txt
    $ ./pmh_ti -p breast -c ../data/hoadley_2016/coloring.txt \ 
    -m 1 -o A7 -F ../data/hoadley_2016/A7/F.tsv \
    > A7/result.txt
    
    $ cat A7/result.txt
    0-	(PS, S)	5	5	2	mS	5146.83	5146.83	9.43489
    1-	(PS, S)	5	5	2	mS	5146.83	5146.83	10.7844

The program `generatemutationtrees` uses the SPRUCE algorithm to enumerate all mutation trees given a frequency matrix. The program `pmh_ti` considers solves the PMH-TI problem for each enumerated mutation tree. The `results.txt` file is formatted in exactly the same way as in `pmh`.
